As the country grapples with the unprecedented threat, smoke moved into parts of north-east US, where tens of millions of people were under air quality alerts on Wednesday and told to limit outdoor activity. Weâ€™d like to hear from our readers on how you are coping, both in Canada and the US. People living in Canada, how have you been affected?

Here is a look at some images across the country as millions of Americans remain under air quality advisory alerts: Philadelphia health officials have announced that the city is currently under a Code Red Fine Particles Action Day Alert. â€œThis means that the air is unhealthy to breathe. Air quality may vary throughout the city \u0026amp; throughout the day, with some areas having significantly worse quality depending on the prevailing winds,â€? said Philadelphia Public Health. It went on to urge residents to â€œstrongly consider cancelling outdoor events and gatheringsâ€? and to wear a â€œhigh quality maskâ€? such as an N-95 or KN-95 if possible. It also urged residents to close all windows and doors to minimize air population and to recirculate the air in homes via fans to â€œavoid bringing more air pollutionâ€? into homes. Concerning symptoms to look out for include difficulty breathing, nausea, and dizziness. Despite June 7 being Global Running Day, numerous running events across New York City have been cancelled as a result of poor air quality. On Wednesday, the New York Road Runners cancelled its Global Running Day events, the New York Times reports.

At one point on Wednesday morning, New York City had the second worst air quality in the world, coming in right under Delhi, India. Mayor Eric Adams has urged residents to limit outdoor activity and warned those with pre-existing respiratory problems to stay indoors at this time. Speaking to the Associated Press, David Hill, a pulmonologist in Waterbury, Connecticut, and a member of the American Lung Associationâ€™s national board of directors, said: â€œWe have defenses in our upper airway to trap larger particles and prevent them from getting down into the lungs. These are sort of the right size to get past those defensesâ€¦ When those particles get down into the respiratory space, they cause the body to have an inflammatory reaction to them.â€?
